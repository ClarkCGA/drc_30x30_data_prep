# Spatial Data Preparation - DRC 30 x 30 Planning

This repository contains a data processing workflow to export geospatial data layers for the 30 x 30 planning project in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) using the Google Earth Engine (GEE) Python API. It computes grid-level summary statistics for various environmental and land cover datasets in the DRC, exporting the results to CSV.

All the data layers are listed in the `gee_grid_analysis/datasets.py`. Any future data layer can be added in this module. 

The output of this repository can be used within the 30 x 30 optimization toolbox available [here](https://github.com/ClarkCGA/drc_30x30_opt).

After running the code an `output` folder will be created where the merged CSV file will be exported to. 

## Requirements

This toolbox is developed in Python. To ensure reproducibility of results, the tool is wrapped in a Docker environment. To run the code locally, you need to install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) for free and follow the instructions below. 

If you are running this on Windows, it's recommended to run it inside Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Follow the instructions [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to enable WSL in your Windows. 

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ClarkCGA/drc_30x30_data_prep.git
cd drc_30x30_data_prep
```

## 🐳 Running with Docker


### 2. Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t drc-30x30-data-prep .
```

### 3. Run the Docker container

```bash
docker run -it -p 8888:8888 -v $(pwd):/app/ drc-30x30-data-prep
```
This will print out the URL to the Jupyter Lab (including its token). Copy the URL, and paste into a browser to launch Jupyter Lab. 

### 4. Authenticate with GEE

Open `authenticate.ipynb` and run the two cells to authenticate with your GEE account in the Docker container. 

### 5. Export Data from GEE

Open terminal in Jupyter Lab, and run the following to export all the data from GEE:

```bash
python scripts/gee_export.py
```

All exports are sent to your Google Drive, in a folder named `DRC_30x30`. You can monitor progress in the [Earth Engine Tasks tab](https://code.earthengine.google.com/tasks).

### 6. Add Neighborhood Information

After the completion of GEE data export, move all the exported CSV files to `data/gee`, and run the following script to add spatial neighborhood information and merge all CSV files into a single file for further analysis:

```bash
python scripts/merge_tables.py
```

This will generate a file named `drc_1km_data_planning_units.csv` in the `output` folder.

## ⚙️ Customization

To change/add datasets or export parameters, modify:

- `gee_grid_analysis/datasets.py`
- `gee_grid_analysis/utils.py`
